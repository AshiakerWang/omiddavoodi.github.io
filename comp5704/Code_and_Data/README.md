To run this, you need to have a working mpi environment and a python3 installation with these libraries:

numpy
pillow
torch
torchvision
mpi4py

Extract the mnist files so that you have a new "training" directory inside mnist_png.

To run the training, use start.sh. All of the files must be in the path "~Desktop/md-gan/" for it to work.
